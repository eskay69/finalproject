                    The experiences and successes shown on this page are not a
                    promise or a guarantee. <br />
                    <br />
                    They merely serve as an illustration or reference as to the
                    potential of what you can achieve when you&apos;re serious
                    with what we&apos;re about to show you and take consistent
                    action with it. <br />
                    <br />
                    As you can see from the results, earnings are different
                    among different people. <br />
                    <br />
                    So note that what is achieved by one person is not
                    guaranteed for another. Each person will see different
                    results. <br />
                    <br />
                    Your success and the results you&apos;ll achieve will depend
                    on you and your effort and willingness to work. <br />
                    <br />
                    And while there may be opportunities, every business has
                    some risk involved. <br />
                    <br />
                    So we beg you to act reasonably by doing research and giving
                    due consideration to the opportunities and risks involved
                    before joining.
                    <br />
