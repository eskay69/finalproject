                    Like most website operators, Ask Mr Geoffrey collects
                    non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                    browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                    browser type, language preference, referring site, and the
                    date and time of each visitor request. Ask Mr
                    Geoffrey&apos;s purpose in collecting non-personally
                    identifying information is to better understand how Ask Mr
                    Geoffrey&apos;s visitors use its website. From time to time,
                    Ask Mr Geoffrey may release non-personally-identifying
                    information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report
                    on trends in the usage of its website. Ask Mr Geoffrey also
                    collects potentially personally-identifying information like
                    Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for
                    users leaving comments on https://askmrgeoffrey.com/ blog
                    posts. Ask Mr Geoffrey only discloses logged in user and
                    commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it
                    uses and discloses personally-identifying information as
                    described below.-

                    amount and type of information that Ask Mr Geoffrey gathers
                    depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we
