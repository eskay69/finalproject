                Before I tell you this is genuine or not, I have some questions
                for you: Will you follow through on my training? Will you take
                your relocation agenda seriously by implementing my strategies
                and following them to the latter? Will you be consistent with an
                hour a day study? You see, most people can be lazy, and many
                find it hard to follow simple instructions.

                strategies that have given my students a band 7.5 and above.
